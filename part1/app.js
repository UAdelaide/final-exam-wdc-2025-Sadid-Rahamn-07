what is an ER diagram


ChatGPT said:
An ER diagram (Entity-Relationship diagram) is a visual representation of data and how different parts of that data are related to each other. It's commonly used in database design to map out the structure of a database before it's built.

üîπ Components of an ER Diagram
Entities

Represent objects or things in the real world (e.g., Student, Course).

Shown as rectangles.

Each entity has attributes (e.g., a Student might have StudentID, Name, DOB).

Attributes

Represent details or properties of an entity (or relationship).

Shown as ovals, connected to their entity or relationship.

Types:

Primary Key: Unique identifier (underlined).

Composite: Made of multiple attributes.

Derived: Calculated from other attributes (e.g., Age from DOB).

Relationships

Represent connections between entities (e.g., enrolls in).

Shown as diamonds, connecting two or more entities.

Cardinality (or Multiplicity)

Defines how many instances of one entity relate to instances of another.

Examples:

One-to-One (1:1)

One-to-Many (1:N)

Many-to-Many (M:N)

Weak Entities

Entities that depend on another for identification.

Shown as double rectangles, with identifying relationships (double diamonds).

üß† Example
Suppose we're designing a database for a university:

Entities: Student, Course

Attributes:

Student: StudentID (PK), Name, DOB

Course: CourseID (PK), Title

Relationship: Enrolls In

Could include an attribute like EnrollmentDate

This would be drawn with:

Rectangles for Student and Course

Ovals for attributes

A diamond labeled Enrolls In connecting the two

Cardinality to show that a student can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students (many-to-many).

If you'd like, I can draw an ER diagram for a specific case you have in mind.








You said:

is this an ER design

ChatGPT said:
Yes, the image you provided is an ER (Entity-Relationship) design diagram‚Äîspecifically, it looks like a logical ER diagram used for relational database design.

üîç Breakdown of the ER Design:
üî∑ Entities (Tables)
Each colored box represents an entity (i.e., a table in the database):

User

Book

Purchase

Review

Rating

Wishlist

üî∏ Attributes
Inside each entity box, you see the attributes:

Underlined attributes are primary keys (PK) (e.g., user_id, book_id).

Foreign keys (FK) are noted, indicating relationships between tables (e.g., user_id in the Purchase table refers to User).

üîÅ Relationships
Relationships are indicated by lines with crow‚Äôs feet:

User ‚Üî Purchase: One user can have many purchases.

User ‚Üî Book: One user can post many books.

Book ‚Üî Review: One book can have many reviews.

User ‚Üî Wishlist: One user can have many wishlist items.

Crow's foot (1‚Üí‚àû) notation is used to show cardinality (e.g., 1 user to many purchases).

‚ö† Constraints and Notes
The Rating entity includes a unique constraint on (book_id, user_id), meaning one user can rate a book only once.

Data types (e.g., VARCHAR, INT, TIMESTAMP, ENUM) indicate this is designed with implementation in mind, not just conceptual planning.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
Yes, this is a proper ER diagram, closer to a logical schema or relational model, useful when you're getting ready to implement your database in SQL. It's beyond just conceptual‚Äîit includes:

Data types

Keys (PK, FK)

Cardinalities

Constraints

You said:
what does unique constaint on foreign keu mean


ChatGPT said:
A unique constraint on a foreign key means that the foreign key values must be unique in that table ‚Äî no duplicates are allowed for that combination.

üîç In Your ER Diagram (the Rating Table):
plaintext
Copy
Edit
rating_id     : INT PK
user_id       : INT FK
book_id       : INT FK
rating_value  : INT
rating_time   : TIMESTAMP

Unique constraint on (book_id, user_id)
‚úÖ What It Means:
Each user can rate a specific book only once.

user_id and book_id together form a composite unique key.

You can have:

(user_id = 1, book_id = 10)

(user_id = 2, book_id = 10)

You cannot have:

Two rows where both user_id = 1 and book_id = 10

üìå Why It's Useful
This ensures data integrity:

Prevents the same user from rating the same book multiple times.

Enforces a one-to-one relationship per pair: (user, book) in the Rating table.

üìÑ Equivalent SQL:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE Rating (
    rating_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    rating_value INT,
    rating_time TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE (book_id, user_id),  -- Enforces the rule
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES User(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Book(book_id)
);

ChatGPT said:
This is a solid SQL schema for a dog walking service, with good use of relationships and constraints. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what each part does and how everything works together:

‚úÖ Summary of Each Table
1. Users
Stores all registered users.

role distinguishes between owners (who request walks) and walkers (who apply to do them).

username and email are unique, ensuring no duplicates.

2. Dogs
Stores dogs owned by users.

owner_id is a foreign key referencing Users(user_id) and assumes that only owners have dogs (walkers don‚Äôt).

size helps with matching walk requests appropriately.

3. WalkRequests
Created by dog owners when they need someone to walk their dog.

Linked to a dog_id.

status tracks progress (e.g., open, accepted, completed, cancelled).

Stores walk time and location.

4. WalkApplications
Walkers apply to open walk requests.

request_id links to a specific walk request.

walker_id references a user with role = 'walker'.

status allows owners to accept or reject applications.

‚úÖ UNIQUE (request_id, walker_id) ensures that a walker can't apply multiple times to the same request.

5. WalkRatings
Owners rate walkers after a walk is completed.

request_id, walker_id, and owner_id are all tracked.

‚úÖ UNIQUE (request_id) ensures a walk can only be rated once.

Rating must be between 1 and 5.

üîê Key Constraints and Relationships
Constraint	Meaning
UNIQUE (username)	No two users can have the same username.
FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)	Dogs must belong to a registered user.
UNIQUE (request_id, walker_id) in WalkApplications	Prevents duplicate applications to the same walk.
UNIQUE (request_id) in WalkRatings	Ensures one rating per walk.

üß† Potential Improvements (Optional)
Role enforcement logic:

You could add a check or trigger to ensure only users with role = 'owner' can create dogs or walk requests, and only users with role = 'walker' can apply or be rated as walkers.

This might be done in application logic, not SQL, but it's important.

Nullable vs. NOT NULL:

Consider whether comments in WalkRatings should be optional (currently nullable).

Add ON DELETE / ON UPDATE behavior**:

E.g., ON DELETE CASCADE for dogs if the owner is deleted.

Right now, deleting a user will violate foreign key constraints unless these rules are defined.

Track accepted application in WalkRequests:

You may want to add a column like accepted_application_id to WalkRequests to quickly reference the chosen walker.

‚úÖ Final Verdict:
Yes, this schema is well-designed and normalized, with good use of primary/foreign keys and unique constraints to preserve integrity. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a diagram based on this or if you want the matching SQL INSERT/SELECT examples!

You said:
Assess if this database is in 1NF, 2NF and/or 3NF and explain your reasoning.


ChatGPT said:
Let's assess whether the DogWalkService database is in 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, based on the SQL schema you provided.

‚úÖ 1NF (First Normal Form)
Requirement:

All attributes must contain only atomic (indivisible) values.

There must be no repeating groups or arrays/lists.

Assessment:

Each column stores atomic values (e.g., username, email, password_hash).

No arrays or repeating groups are used.

Every table has a primary key.

‚úÖ This database is in 1NF.

‚úÖ 2NF (Second Normal Form)
Requirement:

Must be in 1NF.

All non-prime attributes (i.e., not part of a candidate key) must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key, not just part of it.

This matters only if the table has a composite primary key.

Assessment:

Most tables use single-column primary keys (AUTO_INCREMENT), so partial dependency isn't an issue.

One exception is WalkApplications, where a unique constraint is on (request_id, walker_id), but the actual primary key is application_id (a surrogate key), so no composite primary keys are used as the primary key.

‚úÖ This database is in 2NF.

‚úÖ 3NF (Third Normal Form)
Requirement:

Must be in 2NF.

No transitive dependencies: non-prime attributes must not depend on other non-prime attributes.

Assessment:

All non-key attributes in each table depend only on the primary key.

Example:

In Users, attributes like email, role, and created_at depend directly on user_id.

In WalkRatings, rating, comments, etc., depend on rating_id.

No derived or dependent fields like user_age or request_owner_email that might indicate transitive dependency.

‚úÖ This database is in 3NF.

‚úÖ Final Verdict:
Normal Form	Status	Reason
1NF	‚úÖ Yes	Atomic values, no repeating groups
2NF	‚úÖ Yes	No partial dependency on composite keys
3NF	‚úÖ Yes	No transitive dependency between non-prime attributes

Conclusion: The database design is normalized up to 3NF, which is ideal for eliminating redundancy and ensuring data integrity.








You said:
Suppose you decide to modify the Dogs table to also store the name and email of the dog‚Äôs owner directly in the same table, as shown below:

ALTER TABLE Dogs
ADD COLUMN owner_name VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN owner_email VARCHAR(100);
Explain how this change would affect the database schema in terms of normalization.
Specifically, identify which normal form (up to 3NF) is violated by this change and why.


ChatGPT said:
Adding owner_name and owner_email directly to the Dogs table:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE Dogs
ADD COLUMN owner_name VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN owner_email VARCHAR(100);
causes a violation of the Third Normal Form (3NF).

üîç Breakdown of the Violation:
üî∏ What You've Done:
You duplicated data from the Users table (which already stores owner name and email) into the Dogs table by adding owner_name and owner_email.

‚úÖ Still in 1NF:
All values are atomic (no lists or sets).

No repeating groups.

‚úÖ Still in 1NF

‚úÖ Still in 2NF:
The primary key of Dogs is dog_id (not composite).

All non-key attributes (including the new ones) depend on the whole primary key.

‚úÖ Still in 2NF

‚ùå Violates 3NF:
3NF Rule: Every non-prime attribute must depend only on the primary key, and not on another non-prime attribute.

üî∏ Violation:
owner_name and owner_email are functionally dependent on owner_id, not directly on dog_id.

Since owner_id is already in the Dogs table, and it links to the Users table (which already holds name and email), owner_name and owner_email are transitively dependent on the primary key via owner_id.

This creates:

nginx
Copy
Edit
dog_id ‚Üí owner_id ‚Üí owner_name, owner_email
Which is a transitive dependency, violating 3NF.

üö´ Consequences:
Data redundancy: If an owner has multiple dogs, their name/email is repeated.

Update anomalies: If the owner changes their email, you must update it in multiple rows.

Inconsistency risk: Different email values could be stored for the same owner.

‚úÖ How to Fix:
Keep owner_name and owner_email only in the Users table and rely on the foreign key owner_id in Dogs to retrieve them when needed via a JOIN.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Dogs.name, Users.name, Users.email
FROM Dogs
JOIN Users ON Dogs.owner_id = Users.user_id;
‚úÖ Conclusion:
Normal Form	Status	Reason
1NF	‚úÖ	Atomic values, no repeating groups
2NF	‚úÖ	All non-key attributes depend on full primary key
3NF	‚ùå	owner_name and owner_email depend on owner_id, not dog_id directly (transitive dependency)

üìå Summary: The change violates 3NF due to a transitive dependency, leading to redundancy and potential inconsistency.

Write SQL INSERT INTO statements to add the following information. Be sure to:

Use subqueries to reference related data where it already exists in another table. For example, the owner_id is automatically created as the id in the users table.  When adding the owner_id for a dog, do not hard code the owner_id, but rather look it up first in the users table using the username to find it.
If you are unsure how to apply subqueries in this context, hard code the ids in for partial marks and to populate the database for use.
Data to be inserted:
Five users:
A user with the username alice123, email alice@example.com, password hash hashed123, and role owner.
A user with the username bobwalker, email bob@example.com, password hash hashed456, and role walker.
A user with the username carol123, email carol@example.com, password hash hashed789, and role owner.
Two more users with details of your choosing.
Five dogs:
A dog named Max, who is medium-sized and owned by alice123.
A dog named Bella, who is small and owned by carol123.
Three more dogs with details of your choosing.
Five walk requests:
A request for Max at 2025-06-10 08:00:00 for 30 minutes at Parklands, with status open.
A request for Bella at 2025-06-10 09:30:00 for 45 minutes at Beachside Ave, with status accepted.
Three more walk requests with details of your choosing.
** You do not need to hash the password, just literally use the ones given and pretend they are already hashed. E.g. in password hash, ‚Äòhashed123‚Äô should be placed.

Paste your SQL into the box below.


ChatGPT said:
Here is the complete set of SQL INSERT INTO statements to add the required data using subqueries to reference existing IDs where needed:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Insert Users
INSERT INTO Users (username, email, password_hash, role)
VALUES
('alice123', 'alice@example.com', 'hashed123', 'owner'),
('bobwalker', 'bob@example.com', 'hashed456', 'walker'),
('carol123', 'carol@example.com', 'hashed789', 'owner'),
('davewalker', 'dave@example.com', 'hashed101', 'walker'),
('emily123', 'emily@example.com', 'hashed202', 'owner');

-- Insert Dogs (using subqueries to get owner_id)
INSERT INTO Dogs (owner_id, name, size)
VALUES
((SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'alice123'), 'Max', 'medium'),
((SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'carol123'), 'Bella', 'small'),
((SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'alice123'), 'Charlie', 'large'),
((SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'emily123'), 'Daisy', 'medium'),
((SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'carol123'), 'Rocky', 'small');

-- Insert WalkRequests (using subqueries to get dog_id)
INSERT INTO WalkRequests (dog_id, requested_time, duration_minutes, location, status)
VALUES
((SELECT dog_id FROM Dogs WHERE name = 'Max'), '2025-06-10 08:00:00', 30, 'Parklands', 'open'),
((SELECT dog_id FROM Dogs WHERE name = 'Bella'), '2025-06-10 09:30:00', 45, 'Beachside Ave', 'accepted'),
((SELECT dog_id FROM Dogs WHERE name = 'Charlie'), '2025-06-11 10:00:00', 60, 'Botanic Gardens', 'open'),

((SELECT dog_id FROM Dogs WHERE name = 'Rocky'), '2025-06-13 17:00:00', 40, 'Riverside Park', 'completed');
‚úÖ Notes:
All owner_id and dog_id values are looked up using subqueries based on username or dog name.

These statements assume that Users and Dogs are uniquely identified by username and name respectively.

You may optionally add constraints (e.g., UNIQUE (name) in Dogs) to ensure these lookups stay reliable, or use additional filters in the subqueries if names are not guaranteed unique.

Cannot find module 'mysql2/promise'


ChatGPT said:
The error Cannot find module 'mysql2/promise' means your Node.js environment cannot locate the mysql2 module with Promise support, which is part of the mysql2 package but must be installed.

‚úÖ Solution: Install the mysql2 package
Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install mysql2
This will install both:

The standard callback-based API

The /promise interface for using async/await

‚úÖ Example Usage with Promises
After installing, you can use it like this in your Node.js code:

js
Copy
Edit
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

async function connectDB() {
  const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',

    database: 'DogWalkService'
  });

  const [rows] = await connection.execute('SELECT * FROM Users');
  console.log(rows);
}

connectDB().catch(console.error);
üîÅ If You've Already Installed It but Still See the Error
Ensure you're in the correct directory (package.json should be there).

Try deleting node_modules and reinstalling:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
Double-check the file name or path you're using to import (should be 'mysql2/promise' exactly).

Let me know if you're using a framework (like Express) or bundler (like Webpack), and I can tailor the help further.

        const [dogs_data] = await db.execute('SELECT * FROM WalkRequests WHERE status = "open" INNER JOIN Dogs ON WalkRequests.dog_id = Dogs.id');


ChatGPT said:
Your SQL query has a syntax error: the INNER JOIN is placed after the WHERE clause, which is invalid in SQL.

‚úÖ Correct SQL Order:
The correct order of clauses in SQL is:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ... FROM ... [JOIN ... ON ...] [WHERE ...]
üîß Fixed Version of Your Code:

const [dogs_data] = await db.execute(`
  SELECT *
  FROM WalkRequests
  INNER JOIN Dogs ON WalkRequests.dog_id = Dogs.dog_id
  WHERE WalkRequests.status = 'open'
`);
‚úÖ Explanation:
INNER JOIN goes immediately after FROM WalkRequests

WHERE clause comes after the join

Make sure Dogs.dog_id is the correct column name (based on your schema, it is)

üí° Optional: More Specific Columns (Recommended for Clarity)
Instead of SELECT *, you can specify columns:

js
Copy
Edit
const [dogs_data] = await db.execute(`
  SELECT WalkRequests.request_id, Dogs.name, WalkRequests.requested_time
  FROM WalkRequests
  INNER JOIN Dogs ON WalkRequests.dog_id = Dogs.dog_id

`);
Let me know if you'd like to filter by owner, walker, or add JOINs to the Users table too!








You said:
difference between join vs inner join


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let's break down the difference between JOIN and INNER JOIN in SQL:

üîπ JOIN vs INNER JOIN
There is no difference in behavior.

‚úÖ JOIN is just a shorthand for INNER JOIN.
They both return the same result: rows that have matching values in both tables.

‚úÖ Example:
Assume you have two tables:

Users
user_id	username
1	alice123
2	bobwalker

Dogs
dog_id	name	owner_id
1	Max	1
2	Bella	2

Using JOIN (shorthand for INNER JOIN):
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM Dogs
JOIN Users ON Dogs.owner_id = Users.user_id;
Using INNER JOIN:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM Dogs
INNER JOIN Users ON Dogs.owner_id = Users.user_id;
Both queries will return:

dog_id	name	owner_id	user_id	username
1	Max	1	1	alice123
2	Bella	2	2	bobwalker

‚ùó Key Point
JOIN = INNER JOIN (by default)

If you want other types of joins (e.g., LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN), you must explicitly write those.

‚úÖ Summary
Keyword	Meaning	Equivalent To
JOIN	Inner join only	INNER JOIN
INNER JOIN	Inner join only	JOIN
LEFT JOIN	All left + matching	Not equivalent
RIGHT JOIN	All right + matching	Not equivalent

So, you can use JOIN or INNER JOIN interchangeably ‚Äî they‚Äôre the same thing.








You said:
why do i still get dogs_id whould it replaced by the foreign key


ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs clarify what‚Äôs going on when you use a JOIN (or INNER JOIN) and why you still see dog_id.

üîπ Why You Still See dog_id
When you perform a JOIN between two tables (e.g., WalkRequests and Dogs), all columns from both tables are selected, unless you specify otherwise. This includes:

WalkRequests.dog_id (foreign key)

Dogs.dog_id (primary key)

They both may appear in the result because they usually have the same name.

üîß Example
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM WalkRequests
JOIN Dogs ON WalkRequests.dog_id = Dogs.dog_id;
This will return a result like:

request_id	dog_id	time	dog_id	name	size
1	1	08:00:00	1	Max	medium

Notice the duplicate column name dog_id ‚Äî once from each table.

‚úÖ Solution: Specify Columns and Use Aliases
To avoid confusion, you should:

Specify the columns you want

Use aliases to make them clear

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  WalkRequests.request_id,
  WalkRequests.requested_time,
  Dogs.dog_id AS dog_id,
  Dogs.name AS dog_name,
  Dogs.size
FROM WalkRequests
JOIN Dogs ON WalkRequests.dog_id = Dogs.dog_id;
This gives you control over:

Which dog_id to include

How columns are named in the result

üß† Bonus Tip:
If you only want dog details, you can even skip selecting WalkRequests.dog_id:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  Dogs.name,
  Dogs.size
FROM WalkRequests
JOIN Dogs ON WalkRequests.dog_id = Dogs.dog_id
WHERE WalkRequests.status = 'open';
‚úÖ Summary:
Issue	Reason	Fix
You see dog_id twice	Present in both tables	Specify columns in SELECT
dog_id isn‚Äôt replaced	JOIN doesn‚Äôt remove anything	Use aliases or skip unnecessary columns
Want cleaner results	Default SELECT * is messy	Be explicit with SELECT col1, col2...

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS column_name datatype;
‚úÖ This will only add the column if it doesn't already exist.

üî∏ Note: IF NOT EXISTS is supported in MySQL 8.0+ and MariaDB, but not in all database systems.

2. Manually check before running the statement
Run this query to check:

sql
Copy
Edit
SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name LIKE 'column_name';
Or in PostgreSQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'table_name' AND column_name = 'column_name';
üß™ Example
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE Dogs ADD size ENUM('small', 'medium', 'large');
If size already exists in Dogs, you‚Äôll get:

pgsql
Copy

ERROR 1060 (42S21): Duplicate column name 'size'

You said:
INSERT INTO WalkRatings (request_id, walker_id, owner_id, rating, comments, rated_at)
VALUES
(SELECT request_id FROM WalkRequests, walker_id FROM Users, owner_id FROM Users, 'hello', '2025-06-10 08:00:00');


ChatGPT said:
Your current INSERT statement has a few issues with syntax and structure. SQL does not support multiple SELECT columns like that directly inside a VALUES clause without proper structure.

‚ùå Problem in your query:
sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO WalkRatings (request_id, walker_id, owner_id, rating, comments, rated_at)
VALUES
(SELECT request_id FROM WalkRequests, walker_id FROM Users, owner_id FROM Users, 'hello', '2025-06-10 08:00:00');
Issues:

You cannot list multiple columns like that inside a SELECT in a VALUES clause.

You didn‚Äôt define a proper JOIN or WHERE condition to link the data.

You have 'hello' and the date literal in the SELECT as if they were columns.

‚úÖ Correct Approach
You should use a single SELECT that returns one row with all the needed values, for example:

‚úÖ Example: Use Subqueries to Insert Specific Values
Assuming:

You want to rate the request for Max (owned by alice123)

It was walked by bobwalker

The walk request was already created

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO WalkRatings (request_id, walker_id, owner_id, rating, comments, rated_at)
VALUES (
  (SELECT request_id FROM WalkRequests WHERE dog_id = (SELECT dog_id FROM Dogs WHERE name = 'Max') LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'bobwalker'),
  (SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE username = 'alice123'),
  5,
  'Great walk!',
  '2025-06-10 08:00:00'
);
‚úÖ Explanation:
Each subquery gets the ID of a related record (request_id, walker_id, owner_id)

The rating is 5

Comments are 'Great walk!'

rated_at is manually specified

üîÅ Alternative: Use a SELECT Statement for Insert (Advanced)
You can also write:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO WalkRatings (request_id, walker_id, owner_id, rating, comments, rated_at)
SELECT
  wr.request_id,
  wu.user_id AS walker_id,
  ou.user_id AS owner_id,
  5,
  'Great walk!',
  '2025-06-10 08:00:00'
FROM WalkRequests wr
JOIN Dogs d ON wr.dog_id = d.dog_id
JOIN Users ou ON d.owner_id = ou.user_id
JOIN Users wu ON wu.username = 'bobwalker'
WHERE d.name = 'Max'
LIMIT 1;
This joins the relevant data all at once in a single insert.

Let me know if you want to insert ratings for multiple walks automatically!








You said:
Return a summary of each walker with their average rating and number of completed walks.

Sample Response:

[
  {
    "walker_username": "bobwalker",
    "total_ratings": 2,
    "average_rating": 4.5,

You can use the following SQL query to return a summary of each walker, including:

their username,

how many ratings they‚Äôve received,

their average rating,

and how many walks they‚Äôve completed.

‚úÖ SQL Query:
sql
Copy

SELECT
  u.username AS walker_username,
  COUNT(r.rating) AS total_ratings,
  AVG(r.rating) AS average_rating,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN wr.status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) AS completed_walks
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN WalkRatings r ON u.user_id = r.walker_id
LEFT JOIN WalkRequests wr ON u.user_id = wr.dog_id -- Not correct: fix below

        res.json(dogs_data);
    } catch (err) {
